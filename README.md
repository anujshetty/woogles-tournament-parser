## Woogles Tournament Parser
This project takes a [Woogles](https://woogles.io/) tournament URL and uses Selenium to navigate through the rounds and scrape match information. 

This is then converted to the .tou format commonly used for tournament ratings. [Aupair](http://scrabble.org.au/resources/aupair.htm) is the standard program used to open these .tou files. If you use TSH for your tournaments, this [TSH command](http://www.poslarchive.com/tsh/doc/reports.html#aupair) can also generate the .tou file. I have followed these TSH output conventions, especially in cases such as byes etc.
